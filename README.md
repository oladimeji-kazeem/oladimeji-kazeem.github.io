  - <b>[Image tranformation and identification using Deep Learning wavelet :](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_-rnarH1Fzz0JhKpKJBdbB4xdX8CVCbQ#scrollTo=-qAhQn3JOz-4)</b> Wavelet transformation is one of the most popular frequency transaformation that is used for vairous image processing tasks. In this project images were decomposed into different. Several subbands were identified with directional edges which can be used for high level image processing or computer vision algorithms.
  - <b>[Image Transformation using OpenCV :](https://github.com/oladimeji-kazeem/ITNPAI1/blob/master/Deep_Learning_Lab_4.ipynb)</b> Frequency domain transformations using OpenCV libabries with Fourier Transform are very useful for image manipulation including filtering, image enhancement etc. In this project code snippets were built using Fourier transform. dft() and its faster implementation fft() for the Fourier transform.

This practical is linked with Lecture 4. Refer to the slides for various tasks.

Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator
Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
Built a client facing API using flask


Project 2: Ball Image Classifier
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
